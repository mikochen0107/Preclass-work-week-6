# Preclass-work-week-6

There are two options for preclass work. They both use different EconML methods. To make your work easier, I gave the most of the code and expect you to complete the parts that are related to EconML. I highlighted the missing code with "your code here". You are required to complete the option that you are assigned to and encouraged to try the other one as we will be discussing both of them during the class. (Continue discussion during the post session, if we cannot cover all the questions, concerns, hopes and dreams)
