    "An online business would like to test a new feature or offering of their website and learn its effect on downstream revenue. Furthermore, they would like to know which kind of users respond best to the new version. We call the user-specfic effect a **heterogeneous treatment effect**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the business would run an A/B tests between the old and new versions of the website. However, a direct A/B test might not work because the business cannot force the customers to take the new offering. Measuring the effect in this way will be misleading since not every customer exposed to the new offering will take it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business also cannot look directly at existing data as it will be biased: the users who use the latest website features are most likely the ones who are very engaged on the website and hence spend more on the company's products to begin with. Estimating the effect this way would be overly optimistic."

    "In this scenario, a travel website would like to know whether joining a membership program compels users to spend more time engaging with the website and purchasing more products. \n",
    "\n",
    "A direct A/B test is infeasible because the website cannot force users to become members. Likewise, the travel company canâ€™t look directly at existing data, comparing members and non-members, because the customers who chose to become members are likely already more engaged than other users. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** The company had run an earlier experiment to test the value of a new, faster sign-up process. EconML's IV estimators can exploit this experimental nudge towards membership as an instrument that generates random variation in the likelihood of membership. This is known as an **intent-to-treat** setting: the intention is to give a random group of user the \"treatment\" (access to the easier sign-up process), but not not all users will actually take it. \n",
    "\n",
    "EconML's `IntentToTreatDRIV` estimator model takes advantage of the fact that not every customer who was offered the easier sign-up became a member to learn the effect of membership rather than the effect of receiving the quick sign-up."
